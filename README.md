Implemnting the code into your project is an easy task since the code it self is not very complicated to understand,
if you know basic c++ programming.

If you to add build upon this project you're more than welcome to do so, just email me your version of this project @therxpertcoder@gmail.com and I will be sure to included in my repo, after examining the code of course.

crediting the author is not required although it would be much appreciated.
