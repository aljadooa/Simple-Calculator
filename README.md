Feel free to use this software however you like, no restrctions are applied, 
and crediting the author is not required although it would be much appreciated.

Implemnting the code into your project is an easy task since the code it self is not very complicated to understand,
if you know basic c++ programming.

If you want to build upon the exsisting code you're more than welcome to do so, and if you want it to be included in the original code 
just email me your version of it @ thexpertcoder@gmail.com. and I'll review it to check if its doing what its suppose to do.

Oh yeah, this software does not come with any warrenty at all, so if anything happens no matter what as a result of this software,
I and any contributers to this project will not be responsible for it. so be careful when using this project 
and remember you are the one who's responsible for your own actions.
